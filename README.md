# Introduction

A collection of submit scripts for King's College London NAN cluster. The cluster is SGE-based so this idea should work on similar
workflows and machine. The original idea is to create submission cluster scripts (using sge and index) and automate the job creation (per site)
as well as the job submission.

Quite dizzy at the moment but I hope that there are some good ideas in here! Let me know if you find anything particularly useful
or terrible (and feel free to send a PR).
